    <h3>How to Make Baked Plantain Chips</h3>
    <p>For plantain chips that are lower in fat and calories, try baked plantain chips. <br>Baked plantain chips will be a little more dry on the inside than fried, but it's <br>worth the trade off for fewer calories.</p>
    <h4><em>Ingredients:</em></h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2 green plantains</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h5><em>Instructions:</em></h5>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.</li>
        <li>Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Carefully remove the peels of the plantain by cutting of the ends with a knife and cutting a slit down the seam. Pull the peel back from the plantain.</li>
        <li>Use a sharp knife or a mandolin to thinly slice the plantains.</li>
        <li>Toss plantains with vegetable oil.</li>
        <li>Arrange plantain slices in a single layer on a baking sheet and season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
        <li>Bake until golden crisp, about 20 minutes, flipping halfway through.</li>
        <li>Drain plantains on paper towels and serve with Pico de Gallo or guacamole, if desired.</li>
