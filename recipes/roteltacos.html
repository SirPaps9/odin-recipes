    <h1>Rotel Tacos Recipe</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These Rotel tacos are salty, slightly spicy, creamy, and crunchy all at once. It’s like your favorite dip meets the perfect bite of a taco. <br> I recommend extra lettuce for that perfect cold crunch against the rich filling.</p>
    <h3><em>Ingredients</em></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 small onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 lb ground sirloin</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons low sodium Taco seasoning</li>
        <li>8 ounces processed American cheese (such as Velveeta®), cut into large chunks</li>
        <li>1 (10-ounce) can diced tomatoes with green chiles  (such as RO*TEL®)</li>
        <li>8 to 10 crunchy taco shells</li>
        <li>Shredded iceberg lettuce</li>
        <li>Toppings of choice such as diced tomato, hot sauce and sour cream (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3><em>Directions</em></h3>
    <h4>Step 1</h4>
    <p>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add onion and cook 1 minute, stirring constantly.  Add ground beef and cook, crumbling with a wooden spoon until browned and cooked through, 5 to 10 minutes. Add in taco seasoning and cook for 1 minute.  Mix in cheese and tomatoes and reduce heat to medium-low.  Cook stirring constantly, until cheese is melted and mixture comes to a simmer.  Cook for 3 minutes and remove from heat.</p>
    <h4>Step 2</h4>
    <p>Add filling to taco shells and top with shredded lettuce and other toppings, if desired.</p>
